Given a pair of five letter words (called a doublet), this program navigates from the first to the second along a pathway of orthographic neighbors. This is accomplished using a giant interconnected graph structure of five letter orthographic neigbors, which this program creates with 'fiveletterwords.txt'. I've preselected the five letter doublets (such as black -> white, tears -> smile, small -> giant, etc), but you can change them in 'main.cpp' if you'd like.

Do note that I found the header file online.

Make sure to compile in C++11.

Thanks for trying my code!
